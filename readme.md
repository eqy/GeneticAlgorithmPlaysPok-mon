Genetic Algorithm Plays Pokémon
-------------------------------

What if we gave the monkeys GameBoys and positive reinforcement instead?

At this point think of it as an electronic aquarium but instead of fish you have copies of Pokémon Blue flailing about.

TODOs
=====
Tech documentation (approach, scoring heuristics, etc.)
Map number table is incomplete
Genetic Algorithm implementation is untested
Most heuristics are untested
Hyperparameters are untuned (repeat ad-infinitum)
Maybe try seeding with data from an existing speedrun?
